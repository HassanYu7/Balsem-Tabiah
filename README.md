 A Mobile Application for Android 
 <br/> Virtual Healthcare Clinic
</h2>


## Overview

It is difficult for the doctor to manage the clinic on his own, especially if the number of patients increases, and there is another problem, which is when the reservation directly causes crowding and irregularity, especially during the period of the spread of the Coronavirus. . Therefore, the doctor needs to coordinate the appointments. The patient also desires easy access to the doctor, as this is done through a private conversation between the doctor and patients, and in addition to that, the diagnosis makes online by creating a virtual session between the doctor and the patient in which the diagnosis is made if the case does not require attendance.

Our objective aims to facilitate appointments management in healthcare clinics. Through the development of an application, the process becomes easier for the patient as he/she can book an appointment at any time. Moreover, for the doctors and receptionists the process becomes digital and easy to manage. By providing a virtual clinic, the doctor could serve more patients regardless of their location and that as well opens more options for the patients to consult doctors were unavailable for them before.
